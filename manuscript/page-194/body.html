<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">wonderful knocker !â€”Here's the Turkey. Hallo! Whoop! How are you? Merry Christmas!"</p><p>It <em>was</em> a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.</p><p>"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town," said Scrooge. "You must have a cab."</p><p>The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.</p><p>Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are at it. But, if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.</p></div> </div>
