He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when <em>he</em> came. So did the plump sister when <em>she</em> came. So did every one when <em>they</em> came. Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!</p><p>But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there! If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his heart upon.</p><p>And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the tank.</p></div> </div>
