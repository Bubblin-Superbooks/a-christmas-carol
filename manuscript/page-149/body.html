It was strange, too, that, while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children's Twelfth-Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.</p><p>"Are spirits' lives so short?" asked Scrooge.</p><p>"My life upon this globe is very brief," replied the Ghost.
